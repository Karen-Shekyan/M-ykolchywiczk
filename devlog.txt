  - used some API code provided by Astica for use of Astica Vision
  - tweaked code paramters to return desired prompt
  - i added 10 bucks to my account so please do not spam requests to astica they do take money
  - seriously i don't want the money to run out you can only add them in increments of 10 :sob:
  - and do not use any other settings they will go from double the price per request to like 100x the price
  - seriously this stuff is addicting
  - do i need to like credit the astica creator on the code he provided for asticavision use? No liscense information is provided

  - Implemented image manipulation under temp_files.py due to the current problems within __init__.py
  - temp_files.py now allows for the creation of a directory from a room code
  - Also allows for the insertion of an image from an rgb 2d-array image into a png image into specific directory
  - Switched api.py's mode to GPT, now spending $18 per 1000 requests, meaning there should be about 500 requests, or 100 games
  - added keys to .gitignore

  - Rename draw.html to game.html and made it more functional
  - Massively overengineered a COLOR PALETTE
