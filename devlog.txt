- used some API code provided by Astica for use of Astica Vision
- tweaked code paramters to return desired prompt
- i added 10 bucks to my account so please do not spam requests to astica they do take money
- seriously i don't want the money to run out you can only add them in increments of 10 :sob:
- and do not use any other settings they will go from double the price per request to like 100x the price
- seriously this stuff is addicting
- do i need to like credit the astica creator on the code he provided for asticavision use?
