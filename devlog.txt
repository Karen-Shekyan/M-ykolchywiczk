  - used some API code provided by Astica for use of Astica Vision
  - tweaked code paramters to return desired prompt
  - i added 10 bucks to my account so please do not spam requests to astica they do take money
  - seriously i don't want the money to run out you can only add them in increments of 10 :sob:
  - and do not use any other settings they will go from double the price per request to like 100x the price
  - seriously this stuff is addicting
  - do i need to like credit the astica creator on the code he provided for asticavision use?
